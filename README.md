# Document-Scanner

This project can be used for scanning handwritten notes and print documents. This project will scan a document with the help of webcam, then it will print the scanned document which is stacked with original document.


It automatically detect the edge of the paper over a contrasting surface. When using the printed special page template it automatically detects the QR Code printed on the bottom right corner and scans the page immediately. After the page is detected, it compensates any perspective from the image adjusting it to a 90 degree top view and saves it on a folder on the device.

It also incorporates OCR functionality which the user can use to detect text from documents and save them as editable text files in the external storage of the device.
